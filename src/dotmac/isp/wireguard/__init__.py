"""
WireGuard VPN Management Module.

Provides WireGuard VPN server and peer management for ISP operations.
Used primarily for secure tunnels between the cloud platform and
remote OLT/network equipment at customer sites.

Stack Placement: ISP-ONLY
-------------------------
This module is deployed ONLY in the ISP tenant stack (docker-compose.isp.yml).
It should NOT be included in the platform admin stack. Each ISP tenant manages
their own VPN tunnels for secure access to remote network equipment.

Maturity: Beta (~75%)
---------------------
- Server and peer management: Complete
- Key generation and configuration: Complete
- Status monitoring: Complete
- Integration with Access module for OLT tunnels: Complete
